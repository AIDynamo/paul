# About
This is the result of having a lot of free time. The goal of this project is to bring Paul the Octopus into the virtual world :)

It's just one file that takes data from the live score provider, does some calculations and makes predictions. There are no serious algorithms or hard neural networks here. Simple ML.
I would be grateful for your contributions.
